**A library to generate PDFs in client-side JavaScript.**

You can [catch me on twitter](http://twitter.com/MrRio): [@MrRio](http://twitter.com/MrRio) or head over to [my company's website](http://parall.ax) for consultancy.

## [Live Demo](http://rawgit.com/MrRio/jsPDF/master/) | [Documentation](http://rawgit.com/MrRio/jsPDF/master/docs/)

## Creating your first document

The easiest way to get started is to drop the CDN hosted library into your page:

```html
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jspdf/1.3.5/jspdf.debug.js" integrity="sha384-CchuzHs077vGtfhGYl9Qtc7Vx64rXBXdIAZIPbItbNyWIRTdG0oYAqki3Ry13Yzu" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
```

Integrity-hash generated by https://www.srihash.org/

or can always get latest version via [unpkg](https://unpkg.com/#/)

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/jspdf@latest/dist/jspdf.min.js"></script>
```

Using yarn:

```bash
yarn add jspdf
```

Using npm:

```bash
npm install jspdf --save
```

Then you're ready to start making your document:

```javascript
// Default export is a4 paper, portrait, using milimeters for units
var doc = new jsPDF()

doc.text('Hello world!', 10, 10)
doc.save('a4.pdf')
```

If you want to change the paper size, orientation, or units, you can do:

```javascript
// Landscape export, 2Ã—4 inches
var doc = new jsPDF({
  orientation: 'landscape',
  unit: 'in',
  format: [4, 2]
})

doc.text('Hello world!', 1, 1)
doc.save('two-by-four.pdf')
```
## Angular Configuration:

Add following in angular-cli.json:
```
"scripts": [ "../node_modules/jspdf/dist/jspdf.min.js" ]
```
and import it in your component:
```
import * as jsPDF from 'jspdf'
```


Great! Now give us a Star :)
